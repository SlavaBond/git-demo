I wanna be your slave 
I wanna be your master
I wanna make your heart beat
Run like rollercoasters

I wanna be a good boy
I wanna be a gangster
'Cause you can be the beauty
And I could be the monster

I love you since this morning
Not just for aesthetic
I wanna touch your body
So fucking electric

I know you scared of me
You said that I'm too eccentric
I'm crying all my tears
And that's fucking pathetic
